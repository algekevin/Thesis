This is my master's thesis titled "Statistical Learning for Esports Match Prediction". The focus was on seeing which model was the best at predicting the outcome of professional League of Legends (LoL) matches based on information available up to the 15-minute mark. Many models were created, such as logistic regression, LASSO, SVM, LDA/QDA, and I put an emphasis on Gaussian Processes as they are lesser explored especially in the classification area. 

The code was done completely in R making use of the many libraries available on CRAN.
